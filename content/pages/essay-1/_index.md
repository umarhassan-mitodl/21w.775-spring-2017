Eiseley, Loren. "The Judgment of the Birds." In _The Immense Journey: An Imaginative Naturalist Explores the Mysteries of Man and Nature_. Vintage, 1959. ISBN: 9780394701578. \[Preview with {{% resource_link "843a6633-f159-4769-8ee6-9cec0e172c71" "Google Books" %}}\]

\[AE\] Leopold, Aldo. "Marshland Elegy."

\[AE\] Carson, Rachel. Excerpt from "Silent Spring" (pp. 835–848) and "And No Birds Sing (Section 1)." See pub info below.

\[AE\] Turner, Jack. "The Song of the White Pelican."

Each of these authors draws upon the symbolic resonance of a particular bird or group of birds, but the power of each work depends upon carefully observed details. In a coherent essay that develops a unifying thesis, explore the role played by the particular bird or group of birds at the center of one of these texts. Be sure to consider the relationship between the observed or documented details and the symbolic associations of the bird. This assignment is deliberately open-ended to allow you to follow the distinctive path of your own thoughts, but the resulting essay must be tightly organized and well documented.
