You must work with at least three published texts, including one secondary source that offers critical insight into the work of one of the writers you plan to consider (see below for Supplementary Readings for Essay 3).

You must work with at least one text from our common readings and at least two texts that you read on your own (see {{% resource_link "9305c794-9837-e7fa-1ebe-540f1e607425" "Exercises 3.1 & 3.2" %}}).

You must develop an idea that unifies your entire essay. A topic is not sufficient; you must present an argument/thesis. This is not a book review.

You must use MLA in-text citation style, and you must include a works cited list with all of the requisite publication information (in the draft as well as in the final version).

You should expect to rework and expand your essay between the first draft and the final version, but the first version should cover the full range of material described above.

The first version should be at least 1400 words long. The second version will, in all likelihood, be longer.

Your third essay will require that you explore the relationship between one of the works listed below and one or more of the assigned works. You will also be asked to draw upon secondary sources.
