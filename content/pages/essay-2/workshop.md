1.  Begin by numbering the paragraphs of each essay. (If you are working with a digital copy, put numbers in brackets at end of each paragraph.)
2.  Look for and underline the first clear statement of the essay’s focus/thesis/issue. (It might take the form of a question. Just do your best.)
3.  Look for and underline the final clear statement of the essay’s central idea or insight. (This is not a test. Do your best.)
4.  Write up a list of points covered in the essay. (Usually one per paragraph, but in some cases, the writer may have chosen to develop a single point over two or more paragraphs. Occasionally, a single paragraph will cover multiple points.)
5.  Review the introduction and the conclusion. (Remember that the introduction may be more than one paragraph long.)
    1.  Does the introduction set the stage effectively for the remainder of the essay? If not, what changes would you suggest?
    2.  Does the conclusion bring the discussion to an effective close? Does it make clear what the reader has gained by reading the essay? If not, what changes would you suggest?
    3.  Comment on the relationship between the introduction and the conclusion.
6.  Choose (and identify by number) the paragraph that offers the most compelling insight into one or more of the assigned texts. Explain your selection.
7.  Note (and identify by paragraph numbers) any gaps in reasoning. Offer advice to the writer on how to eliminate the gap or gaps.
8.  What single piece of advice would you offer to the essay’s writer?
