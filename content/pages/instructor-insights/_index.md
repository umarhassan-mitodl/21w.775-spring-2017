## How Student Time Was Spent

During an average week, students were expected to spend 12 hours on the course, roughly divided as follows:

### In Class

- Met 2 times per week for 1.5 hours per session; 27 sessions total; mandatory attendance.
- Class time was split into two sessions: one that focused on the student's most recent writing assignment and one that focused on their most recent readings.
- Several class sessions included impromptu workshops where students exchanged short papers or exercises and considered a single question about that exercise.
- For full drafts, workshops were more formalized and students shared papers and exchanged written detailed comments in response to the instructor's guidelines.

### Out of Class

- Completing assigned readings.
- Conducting background research.
- Completing {{% resource_link a7f1ba37-a3f4-4b76-d84a-5e2886b1071f "short assignments" %}}.
